            Captain America
          </h3>
          <p class="card-text mb-auto">
          Captain America; real name Steven Rogers is a fictional character, comic book superhero at Marvel Comics. One of the most famous comic book characters in the world, created by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby for the first time. appeared in 1940s comic books Timely Comics. Over the years, a total of 210 million copies of Captain America comics have been sold in 75 countries (estimates vary, this figure is slightly larger or smaller in some sources)  .
          Captain America is dressed in a suit painted on the motif of the American flag, and is armed with an indestructible shield, which is often used as a weapon. In the comics, the appeal “Captain America” applies to anyone who is selected by the US government (who considers himself “owning” a person) to wear a suit and shield. For almost the entire history of Captain America’s publications, the alter ego of Steve Rogers was a sickly young man whose body was strengthened with experimental serum to the maximum physical form available to a person to help the U.S. military in military operations.
          Rogers has always been a follower of Justice, for which he made many sacrifices; no matter what, always came to the aid of his allies.
          Captain America is a purposefully created patriotic character; he was the most popular character during the Second World War, he was often portrayed fighting with the Nazi coalition of the state. After the war ended, the character's popularity decreased, and by the 50s he was no longer used, with the exception of an unsuccessful attempt to revive in 1953. The character began to be used again in comics only during the period known as the Silver Age of Comics, when he became a member of the Avengers superhero team in The Avengers # 4 (March 1964). He also actively participated in the Altimeyt comic book arch. Captain America withstood the Sentinel's blow.

            Iron Man real name - Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark (English Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark) - character, editions of Marvel Comics and their adaptations, created by writer Stan Lee, screenwriter Larry Lieber and artists Don Hack and Jack Kerby; Iron Man's first appearance was in the Tales of Suspense # 39 comic in March 1963.
            In the original version of his biography, Tony Stark, a brilliant inventor, the husband of Vernalia Lodge and the richest industrialist with a reputation as a playboy, suffers from a wound received by him in captivity, where he was forced to develop weapons of mass destruction for terrorists. Instead, he creates a high-tech armor suit with which he escapes from captivity. Later, Stark improves his armor with weapons and devices created on the basis of his company's resources, and uses armor to protect the world in the guise of Iron Man, hiding his identity for the first time. Go to "# Biography"
            Iron Man, originally a product of the Cold War and the Vietnam War, in particular, was a means for Stan Lee to uncover their respective themes and the role of the American economy in the fight against communism; over time, in subsequent rethinking of the image, the emphasis began to be placed on the problems of corporate crime and terrorism. Go to the section "#Publication History"
            Throughout the time of publication, Iron Man has been associated primarily with the Avengers team, being one of its co-founders, and several side teams of superheroes; his solo series, launched in May 1968, survived 5 volumes, published intermittently in 2008-2012, when it was replaced by The Invincible Iron Man series, until 2014. Subsequently, with increasing popularity, Iron Man became the character of several animated series and cartoons, both solo and as part of the Avengers. In films related to the cinematic universe of Marvel, his role is played by actor Robert Downey Jr.

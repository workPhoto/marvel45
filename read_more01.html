            Spider-Man, real name Peter Parker is a character, superhero, appearing in Marvel Comics comic books, created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Since his first appearance on the pages of the Amazing Fantasy comic book No. 15 (Russian: Amazing Fantasy, August 1962), he has become one of the most popular superheroes. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan teenager, brought up by uncles and aunts, combining the life of an ordinary student and a fighter with crime. Spider-Man received superpower, increased dexterity, “spider instinct”, as well as the ability to stay on steep surfaces and release cobwebs from his hands using a device of his own invention.
            Before Spider-Man appeared in the 1960s, teens in superhero comics were usually just their helpers. Comics about Spider-Man broke these stereotypes, presenting as a hero a lonely teenager rejected by many peers who did not have an experienced mentor, like Captain America with Bucky or Batman with Robin. After the death of his uncle Ben, he had to learn on his own that “with great power comes great responsibility” (Eng. With great power there must also come great responsibility).
            Marvel has released many comic book series about Spider-Man, the very first of which was The Amazing Spider-Man (Russian Amazing Spider-Man); Its latest release came out in December 2012. She was replaced by a series of comic books The Superior Spider-Man (Russian. Excellent Spider-Man). The series ended on issue 31, and in its place came the third volume of The Amazing Spider-Man. The comic was restarted again after the Secret Wars event. Over the years, Peter Parker has been a timid high school student, now a troubled college student, now a married teacher, then the head of a multi-billion dollar company, as well as a member of several superhero teams, such as The Avengers, New Avengers, Fantastic Four.
            The most characteristic image of Peter Parker outside of Spider-Man's life is the image of an independent photographer who has been used in comics for many years.
            Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. With the increase in its popularity, Spider-Man went beyond the boundaries of comics, began to appear on television, in video games and movies. At different times he was played by actors Toby Maguire (the trilogy of Sam Raimi), Andrew Garfield (the dilogy of Mark Webb), Tom Holland (“Captain America: Civil War” and subsequent films in the cinematic universe Marvel) [5]. Rive Carney appeared in the role of Peter Parker in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Extinguish the Dark (Eng. Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark)
